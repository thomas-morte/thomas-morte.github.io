        <h1>What is CTF (Capture The Flag)?</h1>
        <p>
            Capture The Flag (CTF) is a popular cybersecurity competition where individuals or teams compete to solve security-related challenges. The objective is to capture hidden "flags" (usually strings or codes) within various challenges. Each challenge tests a different aspect of cybersecurity, ranging from ethical hacking, cryptography, forensics, reverse engineering, to web security.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Participate in CTF?</h2>
